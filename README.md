# Ant Colony Optimization in Python

This repository has been created to store our small school project that tries to "_solve_" the Traveling Salesman problem with an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm in Python. 

 - [x] Python 3.8.5

### Instructions

* `fourmis.py` is the optimization algorithm
* `n_fact.py` is a standard brute-force algorithm that gives the best solution
* `utils.py` is a repository of functions used by both algorithms

### Python libraries used

* `matplotlib`
* `numpy`
