# Ant Colony Optimization

This repository has been created to archive a small school project that attempts to find a good approximate solution to the **Traveling Salesman** problem using an [Ant Colony Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms) algorithm in Python. 

### Instructions

* `fourmis.py` is the optimization algorithm
* `n_fact.py` is a standard brute-force algorithm that gives the best solution in factorial time
* `utils.py` is a repository of useful functions used by both algorithms

### Python version and librairies

The archived files have been tested with
 - [x] Python 3.8.5

The following librairies are needed:
* `matplotlib`
* `numpy`
